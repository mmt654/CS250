How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this
  I would say that I interpret userneeds through the use of user stories by taking into account what they want and require from a product or an update.
  I read what they want from either dicussions or feedback and pick out key points from what they say.
  User stories help out by laying out these wants and needs into sections that are broken down into criteria for the development of the product.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  I try to break it down into digestible pieces and then after building a skeleton of the program then work on those chunks by difficulty or by importance.
  Some Agile processes I hope to incorporate in my future would be Scrum or the Kanban methodologies because I am familiar with them but would love to use them more. 
  
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  I would say to be a good team member in a software development team you would need to apply yourself to the team effort and to stay in contact with all other team members, work   together with them even if you're having trouble with something in the project keep in contact with them so that way everybody will be on the same level during the development     process.
